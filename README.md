# MatrixMultiplication
<p>This is a program for testing the time complexity of three different algorithms for computing matrix multiplication: Naive, Divide and Conquer, and Strassen's. The main driver has a control variable 't' which is the number of trials it will run each algorithm and average the time is takes for them to complete the task and display the results for each. Some implementations rely upon square matrices as an axiom so the size n is defined as such: n = 2^K where K is an integer > 1.<p>
<h4>Notes<h4>
<p>The theoretical time complexity for the Niave and Divide and Conquer Methods are both O(n^3), and for Strassen's Method the theoretical time complexity is roughly O(n^2.8). However, from my own testing the iterative Naive method was actually most effcient for all testable sizes of n. This is most definitely due to the amount of time and memory it takes fort he recursive calls in the other two methods. Theoretically, Strassen's will become more efficient for some large threshold value of n, but I could not test this on my machine(16 GB RAM).<p>
<h4>Constraints<h4>
<p>The biggest constraint in this work is that I used actual matrices in my implemention for simplicity. It is possible to copy the logic in this program but using a single array and some indexing arithmetic. This would likely improve experimental results' similarity to theroretical ones.<p>
